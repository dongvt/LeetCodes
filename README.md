This repository is to keep record of my learning experience in leetcode. As Today (08/26/2022) I'm transitioning from `JavaScript` to `Java` for many reasons

1. My work uses `Java` pretty much for everything.
2. Interviewers seem to don't like `JavaScript` when doing algo. (I think this is my main reason)
3. `Java` already has Collections and libraries to use `DS`, tool that is highly important when usong platforms like `CodeForces`
4. `Java` is not the faster, but it is faster than `JavaScript`
5. `Java` is awesome too (However, I still believe nothing is better than `JavaScript`)
6. I can be here all day so I just say that this transition is just another step in my coding journey

There are is also the posibility to share premium questions with friends who don't have a premium account.

I'm also using [LeetHub](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/leethub/aciombdipochlnkbpcbgdpjffcfdbggi?hl=en) to push an answers each time I submit code.

If for some reason you are here out of curiosity or something, feel free to add an issue in order to ask questions.
